Cut The pCap : some tools to work with pcap files

Sometimes you have a need for some tools to work with pcap files.
pcap files are the files created with libpcap using tools like tcpdump and wireshark to capture network traffic.
Now you may ask why do you need other tools then wireshark and tcpdump? Well you might not, but from my personal experience when handling gigabytes of pcap data in hundreds of files these tools are to smart and fancy. Ever tried to load a 1 Gb pcap file into wireshark (or tshark)
I putted them on GITHUB so other people can use them to if they want

The main build platform is Linux (Ubuntu 12.04.3) 64bits....
